10/08/2020:-
The initial searching day resulted my acquiantance with some resourceful articles about GANS(Generative Adversarial Networks), link to the stuff:-https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-cd6e4651a29

11/08/2020:-
I went through some introductory videos about GANs, here's the link:-

12/08/2020:-
Recollected and revised the previous two stuffs to get thorough with the topic and infer understanding of alloted project.

13/08/2020:-
Read about the fashion mnist dataset on kaggle:-

Took 3 days break for Pre-qualifier round of TCS CodeVita season 9

17/08/2020:-
Took a sneak peak at the article catered for GANs for fashion mnist dataset;-

18/08/2020:-
Started basic coding in Jupyter Notebook to import and install required libraries and importing dataset. This day itself I got enrolled in a coursera project on GANs for fashion mnist dataset.

19/08/2020:-
Learnt the level-wise tasks and modules divisions to achieve the goal:-
